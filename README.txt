This is the "IN Development" webpage for my wifes new buisness.

This is just to stand in untill there is a full fledged website through squarespace....
I know...square space... but their built in payment and inventory methods cant be beat.
And as I am just starting with server and database style stuff I cant risk messing up real buisness yet with my untrained ego.

enjoyyyyyyyyyyy
